App para la navegaciÃ³n basada en comandos de voz del robot iRobot Create 3.

App for the navigation based on voice commands on the robot iRobot Create 3.

The goal of this Final Degree Project is the development of an Android app for the iRobot Create 3 in order to carry out movements through voice commands dictated by the user. Through an Android app, the voice orders dictated by the user are collected following a set of pre-established commands and are sent to a ROS2 server on a computer to be subsequently executed by the robot. Both the smartphone and the robot serve as an HMI (Human-Machine-Interface) so that the user receives feedback from the robot and the smartphoneâ€™s app to find out if the order has been received and understood correctly or if some error has occurred.

This repo contains all the info necessary to implement the mobile app and the ROS2 server in order to navigate through voice commands. Although you'll need an iRobot Create 3 as well! ðŸ˜†
